    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>My passion for coding came from nearly flunking AP Computer Science in high school. Nothing made sense in that
      class for months. I would re-read books and websites just to make sure I wasn't missing something, but I just didn't make any sense. Then one day,
    like a light switch went off and it all just made sense.</p>
    <p>Now, I <strong>LOVE</strong> coding and everything it can do. From project from scratch to struggling to remember complex or simple things, coding never ceases to amaze me</p>

    <h3>Running</h3>
    <p>Oh the joys of running! More specifically distance running. I started back in middle school and trust me when I say this, <em>"It doesn't get easier!"</em></p>
    <p>I ran for <a href="http://www.yorkvilletrackandfield.com/athlete.php?id=29142&roster=1634"> Yorkville High School</a> and it was
       the best time of my life. I really enjoy 5, 6, and 8 mile runs. It's surprisingly calming and relaxing (once you get passed the heavy breating and sweating).</p>
